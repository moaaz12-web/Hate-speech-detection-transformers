"""
Hi, I'm Grecia, from Mexico. I live in the state of Colima, in Villa de √Ålvarez. In my state you can see two volcanoes. 
One is fire and the other is snow. My cities are aseismic because the fire volcano is an active volcano and it shakes often. 
However, I really like being from there because it is a beautiful and peaceful place. 
The weather is warm most of the year, but there are times when you can see snow on the volcano. 
Volcanoes also serve to orient people because they indicate where the north is.
